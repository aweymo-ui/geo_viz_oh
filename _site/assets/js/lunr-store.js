        "title": "Why Use Audio Narrative in Historical Research?",
        "text": "Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth and I work at University of Idaho as the Digital Initiatives Librarian in the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) department. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department. In addition to this work, I’ve also contributed to a few different projects that have utilized the audio medium to present historical research. Reframing research in nontraditional formats like audio and digital exhibits is sometimes undervalued in academia because the peer reviewed article is a more easily quantifiable and recognized metric of achievement. Consequently, a lot of fascinating discoveries and connections never have an audience outside of the scholarly bubble, because the formatting, language and structuring that makes those research papers easier to quantify to academic reviewers also make them intimidating and/or arcane to many readers. In contrast, using the medium of audio is an opportunity to humanize your research on almost every level. Rewriting your work to be spoken is a great opportunity to simplify and clarify your language. This process is not only helpful in conveying your story to a wider audience but can also achieve an effect of revealing weak historical arguments or speculation once the jargon has been blown away from the text. Making these discoveries through the act of converting your research into other mediums will ultimately make your text versions stronger in the end. &#10042;"

        "title": "Sound and Embodiment",
        "text": "The Empathetic Power of Sound The addition of the voice, whether it is yours, interviewees or oral history recordings that you are utilizing, gives listeners more empathetic context for why they should engage with your story. Visiting the space you are writing about and using portable recording equipment, referred to as field recording, can provide listeners with a sense of place. Ambient audio of a landscape is uniquely context dense, conveying remoteness, urbanity, vegetation density or sparseness, human or animal activity and even the shape of the geography–all without words. Additionally, this is audio information that most listeners can take in while also paying attention to a narrator, because that is the kind of multi-channel multi-tasking that we always do when we navigate through the world. Embodiment Those were all reasons that using an audio medium can be more engaging for others, but the most important thing for you as a researcher in environmental history, archaeology, geology, journalism or interdisciplinary sciences is how it enriches your own understanding of your research subject. While visiting the location you are studying is a fairly straightforward strategy for gaining more context, focusing on recording interesting audio, exploring a space from many angles and interviewing people that live in the area is a form of embodiment. This concept that human experience, perception and interaction with the natural world is rooted in physical, lived experience and that sensory information informs how people understand a landscape. Embodiment is often used to complicate what we think we know about an area and challenge the objective rationalism of science by exploring how researchers reflect their own life experience onto their subjects. In the words of author Christopher Sellers, the embodied approach to understanding place is mindful not only of a researcher’s “geographical ties to a particular place” or their “dependence upon individual perspective and experience; rather, their bodily situatedness to facilitate knowledge-making.”1 Essentially, this means that researchers should be mindful of their bias that they bring to their subjects and focus on the immediate, physical experience of exploring that space to create new discoveries and connections. Portrait photograph from a ninth-plate daguerreotype of Henry David Thoreau, 18 June 1856. Examples of scholars using embodiment techniques to understand places in new ways go as far back as naturalist Henry David Thoreau living and working in Walden Pond and geologist James Hutton making discoveries about deep time and uniformitarianism through repeatedly walking and observing rock formations in Scotland. In the 1990s, archaeologist Christopher Tilley explored how prehistoric people interacted with their landscape by walking and studying burial mounds and stone circles in the UK, assessing physical movement and visibility to reassess how these people navigated the landscape. More recent work by researchers approaching embodiment from sound design have explored how field recording can capture the subjective experience of the recordist’ physical engagement with the environment.2 &#10042;"

        "title": "Field Recording",
        "text": "Nagra IIC portable tape recorder c. 1960 Here are a few examples of field recording being used to convey a sense of place and explore abstract concepts of environmental and climate change wordlessly. The first recording is from Christopher Girot of the Institute of Landscape Architecture and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The initiative involved Girot and students “documenting the melting landscapes of the Morteratsch Glacier region, using underwater and self made contact microphones” creating a”strong sensory experience and a meaningful witness of the rapid changes to come in the alpine landscape.”3 The second piece of audio is from a pretty prolific artist in field recording names Daniel Menche who certainly approaches the medium using an embodiment concepts, capturing sounds at specific angles, distances or at specific times that reveal new insights about a place. In this audio, Menche is recording an especially hot summer day in Oregon when you can hear the “cracklings and hums from the power lines that feed into the big cities.”4 Menche visited a remote mountainside where there are a cluster of electrical towers and no other noise pollution to capture the sound of “corona discharge,” which is the name for the acoustic sound of electricity reacting to humidity in the air on particularly hot days. By documenting this unique area during a heat wave (which sounds miserable to me), Menche’s recording makes us consider the explosive relationship between industrialization and nature and also how these reactions are happening around us all of the time in imperceptible ways. The last recording I would like to share is from the Daniel Bachman, who is a musician that has become more interested in incorporating field recording, instrumentation and experimental sound design to explore the concept of “climate breakdown”, extreme weather events and it’s toll on people and nature. 5 Guides and Equipment Resources Sound experts tend to get extremely fancy and expensive with their gear, but as these last three examples have demonstrated, finding an interesting area and documenting it from unique perspectives, distances and times of day or year are all that’s needed to add singular context to audio narratives. There are a ton of entry level resources for audio recording but this Ear Training Guide for Audio Producers 6 from the folks at NPR is an extremely practical reference for wind buffeting, distortion, hisses and hums that you will encounter during field recording as well as editing and mixing challenges you may find in the later stages of development. Student using equipment in The Studio All of the equipment you need for field recording is available at the Studio, a “dedicated space to students, staff, and faculty to record, edit, and digitize audiovisual content to support their teaching, learning, and creative pursuits at the University of Idaho.” Specific resources include a Tascam Portable Studio Recorder, Logitech headphones, Seagate Portable Drive and WiFi Hotspots as well as desktop computers with the editing software Audacity, GarageBand and, my preference, Adobe Audition. Here is the full user guide to all of the resources in the Studio, the list of video and audio equipment available and where you can reserve a space. &#10042;"

        "title": "Interviewing on Location",
        "text": "Introducing new voices to your audio narrative through interviews is a great way to change the tone and rhythm of your recording, add new perspectives to your subject matter and make findings more nuanced. While you can interview people anywhere, the same principles of embodiment also apply to interviewees when you record people in the locations they are discussing. Examples might be interviewing an animal scientist at a certain spot in a trail where they had an encounter, talking to a business owner in the public facing side of their business and then the back room to see if the setting makes them think of different things, or interviewing canoe maker inside their studio. While interviewing people in uncontrolled or semi-controlled environments presents the possibility of noise pollution interfering with your interview, being on location will often trigger memories and associations that a clinical recording environment might not. &#10042; In a Norwegian paper titled Exploring The Impact of Interview Location on Knowledge Development,7 researchers spoke with 22 cancer survivors, asking them the same set of questions in three separate groups; one at their homes, one in a cancer treatment center and one in at the university where the interviewers were employed. Respectively, this prompted interviews that focused heavily on survivor’s post-cancer lives and family, interviewees having a much more visceral and detailed memories of the medical and institutional aspects of their treatment and interviewees who tended to focus on the impact of the illness in their own work life, putting themselves empathetically in the shoes of their interviewers at the university. Example The Prune Bear This excerpt was part of a public history series that I produced a while ago that explored the history of an area through labor, agriculture and architecture. This particular show was looking at the history of the Oregon prune industry (the ultimately defeated rival to California’s raisin industry) by researching a giant, animatronic bear covered in prunes that was a display for the industry as a part of the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. The bear moved mechanically and was able roar thanks to a phonograph located somewhere inside of it. In this short audio excerpt, I am interviewing third generation orchardist Jenna Fischer inside her grandfather’s 100 year old prune drying barn, which acts a little like a giant oven. Touring the area and interacting with the different tools brings back happy childhood memories for Fischer: Your browser does not support the audio element. As you can tell from the last recording, interviewing on location has it’s difficulties: Fischer moves away from the microphone at times and there are sometimes noises that come from moving around while speaking that you may have to work on during the editing process. Helpful Guides Radio producer Jay Allison has a great guide to the basics of interviewing 8 people in these uncontrolled or semi-controlled spaces, such as recording at an interviewee’s house–where innocuous objects like “air conditioners, fluorescent lights, refrigerators” can tamper with recording quality. Teacher and radio producer Rob Rosenthal also has a wealth of great articles on the Transom.org site regarding setting a good tone with interviewees, being mindful of your own speech that may trip you up later on in the edit and interesting thoughts around structuring your interview questions like a good story 9 to yield the best narrative results. &#10042;"

        "title": "Oral Histories",
        "text": "Another beneficial way to add voices and context to audio narratives is to utilize oral history recordings. One of the advantages of working with oral history material is that it provides a contrast to the commonly accepted historical record by engaging with people outside of the academic community. Mary Malone records Henry Higgs for the Woman's Club oral history project from a Miami Herald article of June 19, 1975, Courtesy Florida Keys History Center under CC license. The practice of oral history initiatives in the United States was first popularized by the Federal Writers Project as a part of the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s and 40s. The first oral history office was created by Allan Nevins at Columbia University in 1948 but the key factor in the expansion of oral history initiatives was the refinement and affordability of portable tape machines. This happened to coincide with an academic interest in social history in the 1960s and 70s and a proliferation of centennial celebrations across the US that inspired oral history initiatives to document the lives of residents who lived through the turn of the century. Digital recording devices, smartphones and the internet have developed the medium farther, allowing remote interviews and community driven initiatives. As the Digital Initiatives Librarian, one of the things I focus on is transcribing our own oral history recordings and creating subject tags so researchers can keyword search and make connections between material, whereas listening through audio linearly for material that may or may not be in a recording has previously made this material a little daunting to researchers. Mary Hillaire To provide an example of an audio narrative I worked on where oral history recordings were key was a piece called Mary Hillaire and the Lummi Nation: Self Determination. The digital exhibit (which has some corruptions in it since it was originally created) and half hour long audio version that I created detail the life of Coast Salish Lummi and adult higher education reformer Mary Hillaire through the dictaphone tapes she prolifically recorded during Hillaire’s tenure at Evergreen State College between 1971 to her passing in 1982. Work print portrait of Mary Hillaire The archival collection, which consists of a mountain of 2142 audio cassettes was extremely daunting for archivists to work through–recording quality was often very low, sometimes the dictaphone was placed on surfaces that were prone to distortion and Hillaire’s oratory style, as she monologues in satellite class rooms on reservations across the Olympia, recapped her day and even recorded phone conversations, could be difficult to follow at times. Through sampling different areas of the tapes over time, conducting contemporary interviews with people that worked with Hillaire and composing a simple soundtrack using the clicks and pops of the tapes themselves, I created an audio narrative that paints a necessarily complicated portrait of a reformer that was perpetually at odds both with her largely White, supposedly progressive administration and her Indigenous community, who made Hilliare feel that she had compromised her values by working inside the institution. Here is an example of how you can create a dialogue within a narrative using multiple oral history recordings and the weight and authenticity that comes from having a research subject relay their own words that quoting on paper just can’t. Your browser does not support the audio element. Resources and Directories A few different places to locate oral history material: Searching our audio material at the U of I Many Paths Many Voices, University of Washington digital collection Audio material at the Internet Archive Digital Public Library of America Collection of nationwide digital collections Calisphere Collection of California state collections American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress Columbia Center for Oral History Densho Digital Repository Focus on Japanese American Experience Oral History Association Directory of Centers and Collections Note: If you can’t find what you are looking for in these collections, remember that the vast majority of all archival material has not been digitized and made publicly available.

        "title": "Structuring Audio Narratives",
        "text": "As I mentioned earlier, restructuring your historical research as an audio narrative can be a helpful way to identify ambiguities in the work and to highlight or forefront material you find most interesting in the research. Some of the restructuring is pretty intuitive–instead of quoting from interviews or oral history recordings, you will just be adding those audio clips to your timeline in the editing process. A more complex challenge is how you arrange your material so it’s intuitive as a story. The Tideflats Map of the Industrial Area of Tacoma, Washington, created by the National Bank of Washington, ca. 1950s. For example, I worked on a project recently that examined an area just outside of Tacoma, Washington called the Tideflats that was the largest meat packing facility west of the Mississippi River in the early 1900s and is currently the location of the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, operated by the GEO Group on behalf of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I wanted to look at the area through the lens of urban planning and examine the ways that both institutions are located just far enough away from the city center that residents wouldn’t be mindful of their environmental and civil impacts but close enough to benefit from tax breaks, trade routes and workforce from the city. Map of the Industrial Area of Tacoma, Washington, created by the National Bank of Washington, ca. 1950s, detail. I opened by walking to the area, which was only about 15 minutes from where I lived at the time, recording all of the ambient noise along the way to give the listener a sense of place. Then I moved the narrative back and forth between the detention center and the packing plant according to subjects that they both shared in common, such as immigrant groups, labor organization and environmental damage, before arriving at a conclusion that repeated and added elements from the introduction. To help orient listeners, I utilized low level instrumental music when I am talking about the historic material and my contemporary field recordings discussing the present day. This becomes an audio shorthand that you can use so the listener knows when or where you are discussing. The E Teacher and radio producer Rob Rosenthal suggests another storytelling structure that may be more dynamic than a linear timeline; the ‘e’.10 Instead of starting from the chronological beginning and working incrementally to the end, you begin at the middle during a particularly interesting or emblematic event, swoop backwards, reiterate the middle again (perhaps from another narrative perspective) and then arrive at the end of your chronology. Dropping listeners in the middle of a curious, incredible or volatile scene can help hook listeners and get them interested in the combination of events that led up to it. &#10042;"

        "text": "The final element to consider during your editing process is the addition of sound effects and music. I find it helpful to think of these elements like punctuation or using a different style of font for a few paragraphs. These can help give the listener a sense of place in history, where recordings of what it would have actually sounded like may not exist. Listen to this excerpt of the Tideflats project I mentioned earlier and try to identify what elements are woven into the narrative and how they might be used to orient the listener: Houses on the Tideflats, ca. 1938, Courtesy Tacoma Northwest Room (A7037-3).

        "text": "Steve Baken monitors prescribed burning research at Worley, Idaho. Courtesy John Marshall. Utilizing audio as a medium for presenting historical research is not just a way to reach broader audiences–it’s also an opportunity to use the storytelling process to reassess and enhance your work moving forward. Transforming written scholarship to audio narrative challenges you to refine your arguments, clarify language and make your findings more succinct. Paring down these elements and combining them with the immersive potential of audio can help bridge a gap with a non-academic community that might otherwise feel excluded from scholarly conversations. Moreover, the process of recording, observing and speaking to people in your area of focus utilizes concepts of embodiment that deepen your understanding of your research subject through interacting with the space. Presenting field recordings, interviews and oral history recordings is essentially just presenting your research materials in an audio format but the medium’s ability to create a sense of place and guide the listener through the layers of a story underscores an empathetic power lacking in traditional academic outputs. By embracing these nontraditional formats, you can not only expand the reach of their work but also enrich your research process.
